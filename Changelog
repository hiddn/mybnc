2020-06-05	v4.3	Sending proper NETWORK value to reconnecting detached clients, instead of just sending "Undernet"

2019-04-04	v4.2	Adding support for CPRIVMSG and CNOTICE: message was not propagated to the other clients of the bnc (new mIRC version)

2015-10-30	v4.1	Bug fix with connection failing to server. Connection timeout to server is now set to 5 secs. 
			Fixed another bug where fd=0 was not considered a valid fd by mybnc, which resulted in bugs.

2012-01-16	v4.0	Bug fix with sendqueue buffer. 

2008-08-11	v3.9	Writes PID to file mybnc.pid when it starts.

2008-02-03	v3.8	Bug fix. The bnc had problems with a '\0' character sent by ircu in the "ERROR All connections in use" message.
					2nd bug fix: I fixed a bug that I inserted when I added the throttle protection.

2008-02-02	v3.71	The bnc now hides passwords from quicklog for privmsgs/notices starting with 'pass' and 'auth'

2008-02-02	v3.7	The bnc now adds own privmsgs/notices to the quicklog
					New conf options: shorttimestamp & wait_throttle

2007-11-26	v3.1	Bug fix with quicklog for maxclients=1 users.

2007-08-26	v3.0	Multi-user support added. The goal is not to allow multiple users to use different bncs on the
					same process. To goal is to allow multiple irc clients to share the same irc connection.
					This is mostly useful for people who want to use the same client to irc from different computers.

2007-07-20	v2.3	The bnc now sends PINGs to the client and expects an answer. It will disconnect the client
					if it does not get one. This way, quicklog will start sooner when there is connection problems
					between the client and the bnc. Added PINGFREQ and PINGTIMEOUT optional config options.

2007-06-01	v2.2	In the quicklog, it was showing '04' for May, fixed by adding +1 to tm_mon

2007-05-22			Fixed a bug in TOPICS.

2007-05-15			Added Timestamps in quicklogs. New config setting: timezone

2007-05-13			Quicklog is no longer lost if the bnc<->server connection is lost while the client is detached.

2007-05-10			Added /vhost and /jump commands.
					Added those config settings: serverpassword, cmd_jump_disabled, cmd_vhost_disabled, awaymsg

2006-08-20			bugfix with nick changes. ircu doesnt send the NICK CHANGE message the same way when it says
					nick change too fast. ircu doesn't add the ":" in front of the last parameter when saying
					"Hidden is now known as Hidden".

/* bug anticipation: if someone who used /ident stays disconnected, quicklog's index may exceed the INT limit. */
